# cs231n -- Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This is my solution to the 3 assignment in cs231n, a Stanford University course on CNN for visual recognition. The skills covered in each assignment:

## Assignment 1
- Naive and vectorized implementation of k-nearest neighbor, and fine-tuning k with cross-validation
- Naive and vectorized implementation of SVM classifier
- Naive and vectorized implementation of Softmax classifer
- Bare-bones two-layer regular NN implementation
- Training SVM and NN on Histogram of Oriented Gradients and a color histogram of images

## Assignment 2
- Fully-connected neural network bare-bones implementation with arbitrary length
- Batch normalization
- Dropout
- Convolutional neural network and spatial batch normalization
- Training CNN with Tensorflow on CIFAR-10

## Assignment 3
With Tensorflow:
- Vanilla recurrent network implementation (Image captioning)
- Long-short term memory RNN implementation (Image captioning)
- Creating saliency maps, class visualization, and fooling images
- Style transfer (creating an image with a style of one image and the content of another)
- Generative adversarial networks (training discriminator and generator)
