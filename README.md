# cs231n -- Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This is my solution to the 3 assignment in cs231n, a Stanford University course on CNN for visual recognition. The skills covered in each assignment:

## Assignment 1
- Naive and vectorized implementation of k-nearest neighbor, and fine-tuning k with cross-validation.
- Naive and vectorized implementation of SVM classifier.
- Naive and vectorized implementation of Softmax classifer.
- Bare-bones two-layer regular NN implementation.
- Training SVM and NN on Histogram of Oriented Gradients and a color histogram of images.

## Assignment 2
